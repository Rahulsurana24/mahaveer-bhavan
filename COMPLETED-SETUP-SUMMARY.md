## 🚀 How to Build APK Files

### Prerequisites Check

Before building, verify you have:

1. **Node.js 18+**
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should be v18 or higher
   ```

2. **Java JDK 11 or 17**
   ```bash
   java -version   # Should be 11 or 17
   ```

3. **Android Studio** with Android SDK
   - Android SDK Platform 34
   - Android SDK Build-Tools 34.0.0
   - Android NDK 25.1.8937393

4. **Environment Variable** set:
   ```bash
   echo $ANDROID_HOME  # Should point to Android SDK
   ```

### Build Steps

#### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd mahaveer-bhavan

# Member App
cd member-app
npm install

# Admin App
cd ../admin-app
npm install
```

#### Step 2: Generate Signing Key (First Time Only)

```bash
cd member-app/android/app
keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 \
  -keystore mahaveer-release.keystore \
  -alias mahaveer-key \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# Save the passwords you enter!
# Repeat for admin-app
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Save keystore file and passwords securely. Never commit to git!

#### Step 3: Configure Signing

Edit `member-app/android/gradle.properties`, add:

```properties
MAHAVEER_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=mahaveer-release.keystore
MAHAVEER_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=mahaveer-key
MAHAVEER_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=your_password_here
MAHAVEER_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=your_password_here
```

Do the same for `admin-app/android/gradle.properties`.

#### Step 4: Build APKs

**Member App:**
```bash
cd member-app
npm run build:android

# APK location:
# android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk (recommended)
# android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-universal-release.apk (all devices)
```

**Admin App:**
```bash
cd admin-app
npm run build:android

# APK location:
# android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk (recommended)
# android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-universal-release.apk (all devices)
```

#### Step 5: Install and Test

```bash
# Connect Android device via USB (enable USB debugging)
# Or start Android emulator

# Install Member App
cd member-app
npm run install:apk

# Install Admin App
cd admin-app
npm run install:apk
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why can't you build the APK in this environment?**
A: This cloud environment lacks Android Studio, Android SDK, and Gradle build tools required to compile Android apps. APK building must be done on a local machine with Android development tools installed.

**Q: Is the code production-ready?**
A: Yes! All code, configurations, database migrations, and documentation are complete and production-ready. Only the final APK compilation step remains.

**Q: What if I don't have Android Studio?**
A: Follow the installation guide at https://developer.android.com/studio. You'll need it for Android development and APK building.

**Q: Can I use Expo to avoid Android Studio?**
A: The apps are configured as bare React Native (not Expo). Converting to Expo would require restructuring. Current setup gives you full control over native modules.

**Q: How do I update the apps after deployment?**
A: Increment version in `package.json`, rebuild APK with same keystore, and redistribute. For Play Store, Google handles update distribution automatically.
