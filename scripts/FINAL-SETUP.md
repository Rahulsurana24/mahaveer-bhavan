### Step 2: Upgrade to Admin (30 seconds)

After creating the user, run this SQL to make them admin:

1. **Go to**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/juvrytwhtivezeqrmtpq/sql

2. **Run this SQL**:
```sql
-- Upgrade user to superadmin
UPDATE user_profiles
SET role_id = (SELECT id FROM user_roles WHERE name = 'superadmin')
WHERE email = 'admin@mahaveer.com';

-- Verify it worked
SELECT
  up.email,
  up.full_name,
  ur.name as role
FROM user_profiles up
LEFT JOIN user_roles ur ON up.role_id = ur.id
WHERE up.email = 'admin@mahaveer.com';
```

You should see: `admin@mahaveer.com | Admin User | superadmin` ✅

### Step 3: Configure Forgot Password (1 minute)

1. **Go to**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/juvrytwhtivezeqrmtpq/auth/url-configuration

## 🔐 Your Credentials

**Admin Login**:
- Email: `admin@mahaveer.com`
- Password: `AdminMahaveer2025!`
- URL: https://mahaveer-bhavan.netlify.app/admin-auth

**Database** (Already configured - no action needed):
- URL: https://juvrytwhtivezeqrmtpq.supabase.co
- All roles, triggers, and policies are active

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Unable to verify admin credentials"

**Check**:
```sql
-- Did you run Step 2? Check the user's role:
SELECT up.email, ur.name as role
FROM user_profiles up
LEFT JOIN user_roles ur ON up.role_id = ur.id
WHERE up.email = 'admin@mahaveer.com';
```

If role is not 'superadmin', run the UPDATE query from Step 2 again.

### Error: "Database error saving new user"

The trigger is now fixed. If you still see this:
1. Check if the user already exists
2. Try with a different email
3. Check browser console (F12) for detailed error

### Forgot Password Not Working

Make sure you completed Step 3 and clicked "Save" in Supabase Dashboard.
