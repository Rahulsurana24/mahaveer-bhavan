# Netlify Routing Fix - Simple Instructions

## The Issue
When you refresh any page on your Netlify site (like `/events` or `/gallery`), you get a "Page not found" error.

## The Solution
All routing fixes are already committed in the workspace. You just need to push them to GitHub.

---

## Option 1: Simplest Method (If you have GitHub Desktop)

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. Click **"Push origin"** button
3. Wait 2 minutes for Netlify to auto-deploy
4. ✅ Done! Test by refreshing any page

---

## Option 2: Command Line (One command)

Open terminal in your local `mahaveer-bhavan` folder and run:

```bash
git push origin main
```

That's it. Netlify will auto-deploy in ~2 minutes.

---

## Option 3: Apply Patch File (If you need the files locally first)

If your local repository doesn't have the routing fix files yet:

1. Download the patch file from workspace: `instructions/routing-fix.patch`
2. Copy it to your local `mahaveer-bhavan` folder
3. Run:
```bash
git apply routing-fix.patch
git push origin main
```

## What Files Will Be Deployed?

These 3 files fix all routing issues:

1. **`netlify.toml`** - Tells Netlify to redirect all routes to index.html
2. **`public/_redirects`** - Backup redirect configuration
3. **`src/App.tsx`** - Fixed to have single root route (Landing page)

---

## After Deployment - Test These

✅ Refresh `/events` page - should work
✅ Refresh `/gallery` page - should work
✅ Open `/dashboard` directly - should work
✅ Visit `/` - should show Landing page (not auto-redirect)

---

## Troubleshooting

**"git push fails with authentication error"**
- Use GitHub Desktop instead, OR
- Run: `gh auth login` (if you have GitHub CLI), OR
- Update your git credentials

**"Still getting 404 after deploy"**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Try in incognito window
- Check Netlify deploy logs at: https://app.netlify.com
