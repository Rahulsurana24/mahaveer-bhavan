# Fixes Applied and Setup Instructions

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… AI Chatbot Now Working Securely
**Problem**: AI chatbot needed secure API key storage without exposing it to GitHub or client-side code.

**Solution**:
- Created Supabase Edge Function (`jainism-chat`) to handle AI requests server-side
- API key securely stored in Supabase Edge Function secrets (already uploaded by you)
- Frontend calls Edge Function instead of OpenRouter API directly
- **Zero API key exposure** - completely secure architecture

**Setup Required**:
1. Deploy the Edge Function (see `DEPLOY_EDGE_FUNCTION.md`)
   ```bash
   npx supabase login
   npx supabase functions deploy jainism-chat --project-ref juvrytwhtivezeqrmtpq
   ```
2. That's it! The API key is already configured in Supabase secrets.

**Testing**:
- Click the floating sparkle button (bottom right corner)
- Ask: "What is Ahimsa in Jainism?"
- Should get a response in English or Hindi based on your language selection

**Security**:
- âœ… API key never exposed in client code
- âœ… API key never committed to GitHub
- âœ… Centralized secret management
- âœ… Can rotate key without code changes

### 2. âœ… Dashboard Theme Updated
**Problem**: Dashboard had white background that didn't match the Landing page's premium dark theme.

**Solution**:
- Complete redesign with black background
- Added glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur
- Implemented orange-red gradient accents matching Landing page
- Added 3D Card effects with mouse tilt
- Added floating animations to icons
- Gradient text effects for stats
- Smooth hover transitions with border glows

**Visual Features**:
- Dark black background with gradient orbs
- Orange-red gradient badges and buttons
- 3D card hover effects
- Glassmorphism (frosted glass) effects
- Floating animated icons
- Consistent with Landing page aesthetic

### 3. âœ… Member Login & Signup Verified

**Member Login Flow**:
1. Visit `/auth` or click "Member Login" from Landing page
2. Enter email and password
3. Click "Sign In"
4. Redirects to `/dashboard` upon success

**Member Signup Flow**:
1. Visit `/auth` and click "Sign up" link
2. Complete 4-step registration:
   - **Step 1**: Personal Information (name, email, phone, DOB, gender)
   - **Step 2**: Address Information (street, city, state, postal code, country)
   - **Step 3**: Membership Type & Emergency Contact
   - **Step 4**: Password & Terms Acceptance
3. Click "Create Account"
4. Check email for verification link
5. Click verification link
6. Return to `/auth` and login with credentials

**Admin Login** (Separate):
- Visit `/admin/auth` or click "Admin Access" from Landing page
- Only users with admin roles can access
- Non-admin users are signed out automatically with message

**Important Notes**:
- Member signup is **fully functional** - multi-step form collects all required data
- Email verification is required before first login
- Admin and member logins are properly separated
- Members cannot access admin panel
- Admins cannot use member login (must use admin login)

## Environment Setup

### Required Configuration

**Supabase Configuration** (Already configured in `.env`):
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://juvrytwhtivezeqrmtpq.supabase.co"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_anon_key"
```

**AI Chatbot** (Secure - No local setup needed):
- âœ… API key stored in Supabase Edge Function secrets
- âœ… Already uploaded by you as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- âœ… Just deploy the Edge Function and it works

**Note**: No API keys in `.env` file - everything is secure!

---

## Deploy AI Chatbot Edge Function

### Quick Deploy

```bash
# Login to Supabase
npx supabase login

# Deploy the function
npx supabase functions deploy jainism-chat --project-ref juvrytwhtivezeqrmtpq

# Done! âœ“
```

**Full instructions**: See `DEPLOY_EDGE_FUNCTION.md`

## Netlify Deployment

### Environment Variables Setup

Add these environment variables in Netlify dashboard:

1. Go to: **Site settings â†’ Environment variables**
2. Add the following:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID = "juvrytwhtivezeqrmtpq"
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "your_publishable_key"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "your_anon_key"
VITE_SUPABASE_URL = "https://juvrytwhtivezeqrmtpq.supabase.co"
```

**Note**: No need to add `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to Netlify - it's managed by Supabase Edge Functions!
