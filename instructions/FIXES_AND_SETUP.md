# Fixes Applied and Setup Instructions

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ AI Chatbot Now Working
**Problem**: AI chatbot was trying to access Supabase vault which wasn't configured, causing errors.

**Solution**:
- Updated AI chatbot to gracefully fall back to environment variable when vault is unavailable
- Added proper error messages in both English and Hindi
- Created `.env` configuration with `VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` placeholder

**Setup Required**:
1. Get a free API key from https://openrouter.ai/keys
2. Open `.env` file in the root directory
3. Replace `your_openrouter_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
   ```
   VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-your-actual-key-here"
   ```
4. Restart the development server (`npm run dev`)

**Testing**:
- Click the floating sparkle button (bottom right corner)
- Ask: "What is Ahimsa in Jainism?"
- Should get a response in English or Hindi based on your language selection

## Developer Notes

### Files Modified

1. **AI Chatbot** (`src/components/ai/JainismChatbot.tsx`)
   - Added environment variable fallback
   - Improved error handling
   - Better error messages

2. **Dashboard** (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
   - Complete dark theme redesign
   - Added 3D components (Card3D, Float3D)

3. **Environment** (`.env`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`)

### Architecture Decisions

- **Environment Variables**: Chose Vite's `import.meta.env` over process.env

- **Theme**: Centralized dark theme using Tailwind classes
- **3D Effects**: Framer Motion for performance and smooth animations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when API key missing
