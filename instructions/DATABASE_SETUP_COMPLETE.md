## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Step Required: Storage Policies

Storage bucket policies need to be set up through the Supabase Dashboard due to permissions.

### How to Set Up Storage Policies:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/juvrytwhtivezeqrmtpq
   - Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar

2. **Configure gallery-posts bucket:**
   - Click on **gallery-posts** bucket
   - Click **Policies** tab
   - Click **New Policy**
   - Add these 4 policies:

   **Policy 1: SELECT (Read)**
   ```
   Name: Anyone can view gallery posts
   Allowed operation: SELECT
   Target roles: public
   Policy definition: bucket_id = 'gallery-posts'
   ```

   **Policy 2: INSERT (Upload)**
   ```
   Name: Authenticated users can upload
   Allowed operation: INSERT
   Target roles: authenticated
   Policy definition: bucket_id = 'gallery-posts'
   WITH CHECK: auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
   ```

   **Policy 3: UPDATE**
   ```
   Name: Users can update own posts
   Allowed operation: UPDATE
   Target roles: authenticated
   USING: bucket_id = 'gallery-posts' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
   ```

   **Policy 4: DELETE**
   ```
   Name: Users can delete own posts
   Allowed operation: DELETE
   Target roles: authenticated
   USING: bucket_id = 'gallery-posts' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
   ```

3. **Configure gallery-reels bucket:**
   - Repeat the same 4 policies for **gallery-reels**
   - Just replace `'gallery-posts'` with `'gallery-reels'` in each policy

**OR use this quick SQL in SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Run as postgres user in Supabase SQL Editor
CREATE POLICY "Public can view gallery posts"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'gallery-posts');

CREATE POLICY "Auth users can upload gallery posts"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'gallery-posts' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Users manage own gallery posts"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (bucket_id = 'gallery-posts' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Users delete own gallery posts"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (bucket_id = 'gallery-posts' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Repeat for gallery-reels
CREATE POLICY "Public can view gallery reels"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'gallery-reels');

CREATE POLICY "Auth users can upload gallery reels"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'gallery-reels' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Users manage own gallery reels"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (bucket_id = 'gallery-reels' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Users delete own gallery reels"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (bucket_id = 'gallery-reels' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

## üß™ Test Your Setup

### 1. Test Gallery Tables

```sql
-- Create a test post
INSERT INTO gallery_posts (member_id, type, media_url, caption)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM user_profiles LIMIT 1),
  'post',
  'https://example.com/test.jpg',
  'Test post'
);

-- Check it was created
SELECT * FROM gallery_posts ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### 2. Test Messaging Tables

```sql
-- Check message suggestions function works
SELECT generate_message_suggestions(
  (SELECT id FROM user_profiles LIMIT 1)
);

-- View suggestions
SELECT * FROM message_suggestions LIMIT 5;
```

### 3. Test Storage Upload

1. Go to your deployed site
2. Login as a member
3. Navigate to **Gallery**
4. Click **"+ Create Post"**
5. Try uploading an image
6. Should upload to `gallery-posts` bucket

---

## üìä Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify everything:

```sql
-- Check all gallery tables exist
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename LIKE 'gallery_%'
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Check all messaging tables exist
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename IN ('messages', 'call_history', 'user_notifications', 'typing_indicators', 'message_suggestions')
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Check storage buckets
SELECT id, name, public, file_size_limit
FROM storage.buckets
WHERE id IN ('gallery-posts', 'gallery-reels');

-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename LIKE 'gallery_%';

-- All should show rowsecurity = true

-- Check triggers exist
SELECT
  trigger_name,
  event_object_table,
  action_statement
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE event_object_schema = 'public'
AND event_object_table IN ('gallery_posts', 'gallery_likes', 'gallery_comments', 'messages')
ORDER BY event_object_table, trigger_name;
```
