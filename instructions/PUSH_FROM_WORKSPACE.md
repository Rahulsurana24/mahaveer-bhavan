# Push Routing Fix from Workspace

## Issue
The GitHub token in the workspace has expired. We need to update it to push the routing fixes.

---

## Solution: Update GitHub Token

### Step 1: Generate New GitHub Token

1. Go to: **https://github.com/settings/tokens/new**
2. Login to your GitHub account
3. Fill in:
   - **Note**: `mahaveer-bhavan-workspace`
   - **Expiration**: `90 days` (or your preference)
   - **Scopes**: Check these boxes:
     - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     - ✅ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
4. Scroll down and click **"Generate token"**
5. **Copy the token** (starts with `ghp_` or `github_pat_`)
   - ⚠️ You can only see it once!

### Step 2: Provide Token to Continue

Once you have the token, share it here and I'll:
1. Update the git remote configuration
2. Push all 147 commits to GitHub
3. Netlify will auto-deploy the routing fix

---

## What Happens Next

```
Your GitHub → Generate Token → Share with me
    ↓
Update git remote in workspace
    ↓
Push 147 commits to GitHub
    ↓
Netlify auto-deploys (2-3 minutes)
    ↓
✅ All routing issues fixed
```

---

## Alternative: Use GitHub Web Interface

If you prefer not to share a token, you can manually upload the files:

### Files to Upload on GitHub.com:

1. **`netlify.toml`** (in repository root)
2. **`public/_redirects`** (in public folder)
3. **Update `src/App.tsx`** (apply changes from routing-fix.patch)

This is more manual but doesn't require token access.

---

## Security Note

- The token will only be used to push to your repository
- You can revoke it anytime at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- It's stored only in this workspace session

---

**Next step:** Generate a GitHub token and share it, or let me know if you prefer the manual upload method.
