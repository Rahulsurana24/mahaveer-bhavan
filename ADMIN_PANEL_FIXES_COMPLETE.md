# Admin Panel Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Admin Creation "User Not Allowed" Error
**Problem:** Superadmin could not create new admin users due to RLS policy restrictions.

**Solution:** Updated RLS policies on `user_profiles` table to allow superadmins full control:
- Created separate policies for viewing, updating, and managing profiles
- Superadmins can now create and update all user profiles
- Regular admins can only update non-admin member profiles
- Users can update their own basic profile but cannot change their role

**Status:** Fixed via SQL script (see fix_admin_features.sql)

---

### 2. ✅ Settings Page "Page Not Found" Error
**Problem:** Settings page was returning 404 because route protection was incorrect.

**Solution:** Changed route protection from `requireAdmin` to `requireSuperAdmin`:
```typescript
// Before: <ProtectedRoute requireAdmin>
// After:  <ProtectedRoute requireSuperAdmin>
```

**File Modified:** `src/App.tsx`

**Rationale:** System settings (email, WhatsApp, payment configs) should only be accessible to superadmins for security.

---

### 3. ✅ Gallery Management Missing from Navigation
**Problem:** Gallery Management page existed but wasn't accessible from admin sidebar.

**Solution:** Added Gallery to admin navigation with Image icon:
```typescript
{ icon: Image, label: "Gallery", path: "/admin/gallery" }
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/layout/admin-layout.tsx` - Added Gallery nav item
- Already had route in `src/App.tsx`
- Already had `src/pages/admin/GalleryManagement.tsx` page

**Status:** Complete and functional

---

### 4. ✅ Member ID Prefixes Fixed
**Problem:** Old prefixes were TR, TP, KR, LB, EX - needed to be K, T, L, E, TR.

**New Prefix Mapping:**
- **Karyakarta** → `K-001`, `K-002`, `K-003`, etc.
- **Tapasvi** → `T-001`, `T-002`, `T-003`, etc.
- **Labharti** → `L-001`, `L-002`, `L-003`, etc.
- **Extra** → `E-001`, `E-002`, `E-003`, etc.
- **Trustee** → `TR-001`, `TR-002`, `TR-003`, etc.

**Solution:** Updated `generate_member_id()` function in database to use new prefixes with proper auto-incrementing per type.

**Status:** Fixed via SQL script (see fix_admin_features.sql)

---

### 5. ✅ Password Setting for Member Login
**Problem:** When admin creates a member, how does the member get their password?

**Solution:** Added password field with auto-generate button:
- Password field now visible in Create Member dialog
- "Generate Password" button (RefreshCw icon) creates secure 12-character password
- Admin can see and copy the password to share with the member
- Password uses alphanumeric + special characters
- Member can change password later from their profile

**File Modified:** `src/components/admin/CreateMemberDialog.tsx`

**UI Changes:**
- Password field shows generated password in plain text (so admin can copy it)
- Generate button creates: `aB3!xY9@mN2$` style passwords
- Toast notification confirms password generation
- Membership type dropdown now shows prefixes: "Karyakarta (K-###)"
