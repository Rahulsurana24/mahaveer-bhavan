# Critical Database and Authentication Fixes - DEPLOYED

**Deployment Date**: October 24, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ ALL CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED
**Auto-Deploy**: Netlify deploying from GitHub `main` branch

---

## üî• Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Member Login Not Working
**Problem**: Login button did nothing, no errors in console
**Root Cause**: Authentication flow was correct, but profile data wasn't loading after login
**Solution**:
- Fixed `useMemberData` hook to query correct table (`members` instead of `user_profiles`)
- Updated authentication context to properly handle member data
- Database trigger now creates entries in both `user_profiles` and `members` tables

**Files Modified**:
- `src/hooks/useMemberData.ts`
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- `supabase/migrations/20251024102000_fix_schema_properly.sql`

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Signup Page Not Working
**Problem**: Users couldn't sign up from public signup page (but admins could create them)
**Root Cause**:
- Database constraints too strict (required fields like `phone`, `address`, `photo_url`)
- Trigger function not creating complete member entries
- Update operations failing due to RLS policies

**Solution**:
- Relaxed NOT NULL constraints on `members` table
- Updated `handle_new_user` trigger to create both `user_profiles` and `members` entries
- Modified signup flow to update both tables with complete member data
- Added proper RLS policies for member creation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced signUp function
- `src/components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx` - Proper data structure
- `supabase/migrations/20251024103000_relax_members_constraints.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20251024102000_fix_schema_properly.sql`

**Database Changes**:
```sql
-- Relaxed constraints
ALTER TABLE members ALTER COLUMN phone DROP NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE members ALTER COLUMN address DROP NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE members ALTER COLUMN date_of_birth DROP NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE members ALTER COLUMN photo_url DROP NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE members ALTER COLUMN emergency_contact DROP NOT NULL;

-- Added 'member' to allowed membership types
ALTER TABLE members ADD CONSTRAINT members_membership_type_check
  CHECK (membership_type = ANY (ARRAY['Trustee', 'Tapasvi', 'Karyakarta', 'Labharti', 'Extra', 'member']));
```

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Profile Page Loading Error
**Problem**: "Failed to load profile. Please try again." error on profile page
**Root Cause**: Profile page querying `members` table but hook was querying `user_profiles`
**Solution**:
- Updated `useMemberData` hook to query `members` table
- Updated Profile page operations to use `members` table
- Ensured data transformation handles both table structures

**Files Modified**:
- `src/hooks/useMemberData.ts`
- `src/pages/Profile.tsx`

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Admin Creation Database Errors
**Problem**: "Database error while creating new admins"
**Root Cause**: RLS policies blocking admin updates to `user_profiles` table
**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive RLS policies for admins to manage profiles
- Ensured `update_user_role` RPC function exists (it does)
- Added `SECURITY DEFINER` to trigger function to bypass RLS
- Granted proper permissions to authenticated users

**Database Policies Added**:
```sql
-- Admins can create profiles
CREATE POLICY "Admins can create profiles"
ON user_profiles FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (admin check...);

-- Admins can update any profile
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update profiles"
ON user_profiles FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (admin check...) WITH CHECK (admin check...);

-- Admins can view all profiles
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all profiles"
ON user_profiles FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (auth_id = auth.uid() OR admin check...);
```

**Files Modified**:
- `supabase/migrations/20251024101000_fix_all_critical_issues.sql`

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Attendance Marking Not Working
**Problem**: Unable to mark attendance
**Root Cause**:
- RLS policies had type mismatches (`member_id` is TEXT in `attendance_records`)
- Missing or incorrect policies

**Solution**:
- Fixed RLS policies with proper type casting
- Ensured `attendance_items` and `attendance_records` tables exist
- Created proper indexes for performance

**Database Changes**:
```sql
-- Fixed with proper type casting
CREATE POLICY "Users view own attendance"
ON attendance_records FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  member_id IN (SELECT id::text FROM members WHERE auth_id = auth.uid())
  OR admin check...
);

CREATE POLICY "Admins manage attendance"
ON attendance_records FOR ALL TO authenticated
USING (admin check...);
```

**Files Modified**:
- `supabase/migrations/20251024102000_fix_schema_properly.sql`

---

### 6. ‚úÖ Calendar Event Creation Not Working
**Problem**: Unable to create calendar event items
**Root Cause**:
- RLS policies referencing wrong column names
- Events table schema mismatch (uses `is_published` not `status`)

**Solution**:
- Updated RLS policies to use correct column names (`is_published`, `date` not `start_date`)
- Ensured `events` and `event_registrations` tables have proper policies
- Fixed type casting for event registration policies

**Database Changes**:
```sql
-- Fixed to use actual column name
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view published events"
ON events FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (is_published = true);

-- Fixed event registrations with proper types
CREATE POLICY "Users can register for events"
ON event_registrations FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  member_id IN (SELECT id::text FROM members WHERE auth_id = auth.uid())
);
```

**Files Modified**:
- `supabase/migrations/20251024102000_fix_schema_properly.sql`

## üìä Database Schema Understanding

The system uses **TWO** main tables for user data:

### `user_profiles` Table (UUID IDs)
- Primary authentication and permissions table
- Linked to `auth.users` via `auth_id`
- Contains role assignments via `role_id` ‚Üí `user_roles`
- Used for: Authentication, authorization, role management

### `members` Table (TEXT IDs)
- Primary member data table
- Linked to `auth.users` via `auth_id`
- Contains complete member information (phone, address, etc.)
- ID format: `MEM-YYYYMMDD-XXXX`
- Used for: Member profiles, attendance, event registrations

### Sync Process
When a user signs up:
1. `auth.users` entry created by Supabase Auth
2. Trigger `handle_new_user` fires automatically
3. Creates `user_profiles` entry (for permissions)
4. Creates `members` entry (for member data)
5. Signup updates both tables with complete information

---

## üîê Security Improvements

### SQL Injection Protection
- All database queries use Supabase client (parameterized queries)
- RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access
- SECURITY DEFINER functions bypass RLS only where needed

### Row Level Security (RLS)
‚úÖ All tables have RLS enabled:
- `user_profiles` - Users see own, admins see all
- `members` - Users update own, admins manage all
- `attendance_records` - Users see own, admins manage all
- `attendance_items` - All view active, admins manage
- `events` - All view published, admins manage
- `event_registrations` - Users register self, admins manage all

## üìû Support

If any issues persist:

1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
