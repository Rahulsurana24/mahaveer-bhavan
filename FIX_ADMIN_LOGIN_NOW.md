   ```
   (Replace `your-app-name` with your actual Netlify app name)

3. **Fill in EXACTLY:**
   - Email: `rahulsuranat@gmail.com`
   - Password: `9480413653`
   - Name: `Super Admin`

4. **Click "Sign Up" button**

5. **Switch to "Login" tab**

‚úÖ **You should now be logged in as admin!**

### Step 3: Verify It Works (1 minute)

1. After login, you should see the **Admin Dashboard**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Change Password!

## üîç If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check 1: Verify SQL Ran Successfully

Go back to Supabase SQL Editor and run:

```sql
-- Check if superadmin role exists
SELECT * FROM user_roles WHERE name = 'superadmin';

-- Check if trigger exists
SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'on_auth_user_created';
```

Both should return results. If not, run the SQL again.

---

### Check 2: Verify Netlify Environment Variables

Your app is already configured correctly! The credentials are hardcoded in the client file:
- URL: `https://juvrytwhtivezeqrmtpq.supabase.co`
- Key: `eyJhbG...` (already set)

No changes needed! ‚úÖ

---

### Check 3: If "User Already Exists" Error

If signup says user already exists, run this in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Clean up existing user
DO $$
DECLARE
  v_auth_id uuid;
BEGIN
  SELECT id INTO v_auth_id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'rahulsuranat@gmail.com';
  IF v_auth_id IS NOT NULL THEN
    DELETE FROM user_profiles WHERE auth_id = v_auth_id;
    DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE id = v_auth_id;
  END IF;
END $$;
```

Then try signing up again.

---

### Check 4: Manual User Creation (Last Resort)

If signup through UI doesn't work:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/juvrytwhtivezeqrmtpq/auth/users
   ```

2. **Click "Invite User"**

3. **Enter:**
   - Email: `rahulsuranat@gmail.com`
   - Check "Auto Confirm Email"

4. **Click "Send Invite"**

5. **After user is created, run in SQL Editor:**
   ```sql
   -- Assign superadmin role
   UPDATE user_profiles
   SET role_id = (SELECT id FROM user_roles WHERE name = 'superadmin'),
       needs_password_change = false
   WHERE auth_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'rahulsuranat@gmail.com');
   ```

6. **Set password:**
   - Go back to Authentication ‚Üí Users
   - Find `rahulsuranat@gmail.com`
   - Click three dots ‚Üí "Reset Password"
   - Set to: `9480413653`

7. **Now log in through the app!**
