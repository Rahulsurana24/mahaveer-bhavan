## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Admin Panel Doesn't Load

**Step 1: Verify You're Logged In**
```
https://mahaveer-bhavan.netlify.app/diagnostic
```

This page will show:
- ✅ Whether you're authenticated
- ✅ Your current role (should be "superadmin")
- ✅ Any issues blocking access

**Step 2: Check Browser Console**
- Press F12 to open Developer Tools
- Go to Console tab
- Look for any red errors
- Share errors if you see any

**Step 3: Clear Browser Cache**
- Sometimes old cached files cause issues
- Clear cache and reload: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

**Step 4: Verify Session**
Run this in browser console:
```javascript
const checkAuth = async () => {
  const supabase = (await import('https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2')).createClient(
    'https://juvrytwhtivezeqrmtpq.supabase.co',
    'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Imp1dnJ5dHdodGl2ZXplcXJtdHBxIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTgzOTMzMDksImV4cCI6MjA3Mzk2OTMwOX0.kElx1ywKoltQxqOd0cP0_Fw9b4kDdd-syZbIhwD61tc'
  );
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  console.log('Logged in:', !!user, 'Email:', user?.email);
  return user;
};
checkAuth();
```
